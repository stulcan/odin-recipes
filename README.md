Project Learning Expectations

This project will revolve around building a recipe website. There will be a main index page that links to different recipes. I expect to practice all matters of the foundational HTML I have learned up to this point like tags, elements, links (both relative and absolute), strong and emphasized texts, links, and writing good commit messages as I go.

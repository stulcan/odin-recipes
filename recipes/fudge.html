        <h1>Heidi's Fantastic Fudge</h1>

        <img src="https://www.eglsf.info/wp-content/uploads/image-missing.png" alt="Yummy fudge">

        <h2>Description</h2>

            <p>This fudge has an excellent backstory. A young girl had no friends, so her mom made fudge for her to take around and share with other kids in the hopes of making friends. It never seemed to work, not because the fudge wasn't delicious, but because the young girl was just too weird. I'm talking bangs that would make Sia jealous! Anyways, the fudge still got named after the girl.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
                <li>4 3/4 cup sugar</li>
                <li>12 ounces evaporated milk</li>
                <li>12 ounces semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
                <li>11.5 ounces milk chocolate ships</li>
                <li>13-14 ounces marshmallow creme or marshmallow fluff</li>
                <li>2 cups nuts (walnuts, pecans, almonds, chopped)</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon imitation butter flavor</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>

            <ol>
                <li>Line a 13x9 inch pan with aluminum foil, butter the insides, and set aside</li>
                <li>Place chips, vanilla & butter flavor, about half the marshmallow creme, and nuts into a large saucepan or Pyrex glass dish and set aside</li>
                <li>Use medium heat to bring the milk and sugar to a rolling boil while stirring constantly with a wooden spoon or single stem hand mixer</li>
                <li>Add half the marshmallow creme (or 2 cups of mini-marshmallows) - fold in - the boil will stop</li>
                <li>Bring back to a rolling boil and continue to boil for 8 full minutes by the clock (start timing once the marshmallows have melted and the boil has resumed)</li>
                <li>The mixture will expand and start to turn brown during the boil</li>
                <li>If you get brown flakes in the mixture,then turn down the heat a little and continue stirring</li>
                <li>Remove from heat, mix in the butter, and pour hot mixture over chips, vanilla, and nuts without scraping the sides of the hot saucepan</li>
                <li>Mix thoroughly and pour into prepared pan</li>
                <li>Cool 2-3 hours at room temperature</li>
                <li>Remove from pan, remove foil, cut into squares</li>
                <li>Store in an airtight container with wax paper dividers for up to 2 weeks (makes about 4 pounds of fudge)</li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
